This repository contains the code for the **Super Math Board**, a fun, animated web application for kids. Users can draw a math problem on the digital chalkboard, and clicking "Solve It!" sends the drawing to a multimodal AI (Google's Gemini) which recognizes the handwriting, solves the problem, and displays the answer back on the board.

This project is built from a single `index.html` file and features:
* **HTML5 Canvas** for drawing
* **Tailwind CSS** for a vibrant, kid-friendly UI
* **JavaScript** to handle drawing logic, animations, and API calls
* **Custom Animations** including a pen cursor, a "bouncing dots" loader, and a realistic two-pass eraser sweep.
